        <p>Hello! My name is Isadora Paula, and I am from Fortaleza, Brazil. I enjoy singing, watching series, taking
            pictures, and
            I really like sports. I am currently studying Software Development at BYU Idaho. I am excited to learn as
            much as I can
            about programming, web development, and design.
            I am looking forward to creating my own website and learning more about the industry. I am excited to see
            what comes
            next!!!</p>
